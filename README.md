# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping Earthquakes Coordinates using JavaScript 

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

Tasks
To complete this project, we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then added the data to a map.

Approach
Our approach is to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data.
